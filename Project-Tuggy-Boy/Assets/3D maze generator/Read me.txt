3D Maze generator, By NanoH {Hoedus.net}

Hi, and thank you for buying my 3D Maze generator. please read the few following instructions to make a better usage of this package.

1 - Presentation.

	This package contain a prefab named "3D Maze", who is a full customisable 3D maze generator.
	By 3D, i mean that you can generate a maze with more than one floor. You can, for example, make a cubic maze of 10*10*10,
	that is by the way the default configuration of the prefab.
	The algorithm used for the generation is the "Kruskal's Algorithm".
	
	How to use it?
	It is very simple: You have a prefab named "3D Maze" in the main folder of the package. Simply drag it in your scene, where you want the maze to spawn.
	Set the differents options of the script attached to the prefab, and launch the scene. The maze will spawn instantly.
	
2 - Parameters.

	Here are the parameters you can manipulate:
		
		- Horizontal wall / Vertical wall / floor / corner : You can create your own prefab for your walls and floors, who will be used for the generation.
		You can also keep the default pieces and change de materials applicated on them (materials floor and wall)
		
		- NEW - Optimize corners: id this option is checked, the generation will not instantiate the corner pieces where there is two wall directly
		connected and parralel
		
		- Width / depth / height : The dimensions of your maze. the height represents the number of floors
		
		- Wall Height: The height of a single floor
		
		- Floor Size: The side size of a single floor. IMPORTANT NOTE: The parts of your maze do not automatically fit with the two prior parameters.
		for example, the height of your game objects "walls" have to be the same of the "Wall Heigth" parameter. Otherwise, you will have very strange mazes...
		
		- Roof: check this box if you want your maze to have a roof
		
		- Exits in floor: number of holes you want to have in your floors
		
		- Exits in walls: Number of holes you want to have in the external walls of your maze
		
		- Rand floor exits : if this box is checked, the holes in the floors will be placed at random. other wise, they will be placed at {0,0} and {max,max}
		
		- Rand walls exits : if this box is checked, the holes in the external walls will be placed at random. other wise, they will be placed at {0,0} and {max,max} in the horizontal walls
		
3 - Important notes:

	In a single 3D maze, the different floors will inherit of the same parameters. If you want an easy way to have floors with different parameters, try to add a 3Dmaze with "Height" set to 1, "Roof" disabled,
	and stack them one on each other.
	
	The file "maze_generation" contains two classes "Maze" and "Maze3d". You can use them in a script without using the instantiation script "maze generation",
	so you can change the data after a procedural generation, to make exactly the maze you want.
