# Game Design and Development II

In this course we must implement a game with a specific device. We get the Oculus Rift and make a little remake of a very popular game.

## Short Description

Everyone knows PacMan. We decided to make a remake of the genius retro game. Our main character is Tuggy Boy.
The world of Tuggy Boy is a 3D Maze with multiple floors, but every level has a own story.

The player see the growth of Tuggy Boy, therefore the first level look like a "play" - carpet. We created every level with the growth - step of Tuggy Boy. 

The goal of every level is the collect all collectables, but there are also enemies, who wanna damage our main character.
